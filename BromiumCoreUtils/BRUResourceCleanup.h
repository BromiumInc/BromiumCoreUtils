/**
 * This class helps with setting up a series of resources whereby any step can fail. The idea is that after each
 * individual step you perform the following work:
 *  - specify a cleanup block (`addResource*Block`) to destruct the newly successfully acquired resource in case a
 *    subsequent step fails
 *  - call `-runAllCleanupsWithError:` if your resource acquisition fails
 *
 * `-runAllCleanupsWithError:` will run all the previously added resource cleanup blocks in _reverse order_.
 *
 * If all steps succeeded, you must call `-discardAllCleanups` to tell the `BRUResourceCleanups` that it is no longer
 * needed.
 *
 * It is illegal to let a `BRUResourceCleanup` go out of scope without either calling `-discardAllCleanups` (if success)
 * or `-runAllCleanupsWithError:` (on error).
